#Finally, copy in your previous functions and write code that opens the file project_twitter_data.csv
# which has the fake generated twitter data (the text of a tweet,
# the number of retweets of that tweet, and the number of replies to that tweet). 
#Your task is to build a sentiment classifier, which will detect how positive or negative each tweet is. 
#Copy the code from the code windows above, and put that in the top of this code window. 
#Now, you will write code to create a csv file called resulting_data.csv, which contains the Number of Retweets,
# Number of Replies, Positive Score (which is how many happy words are in the tweet), 
#Negative Score (which is how many angry words are in the tweet), and the Net Score (
# how positive or negative the text is overall) for each tweet. The file should have those headers in that order. 
#Remember that there is another component to this project. You will upload the csv file to Excel or Google Sheets 
#and produce a graph of the Net Score vs Number of Retweets. Check Coursera for that portion of the assignment, 
#if youâ€™re accessing this textbook from Coursera.

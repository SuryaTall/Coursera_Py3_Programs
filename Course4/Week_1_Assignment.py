#Create a class called AppleBasket whose constructor accepts two inputs:
#  a string representing a color, and a number representing a quantity of apples. 
# The constructor should initialize two instance variables: apple_color and apple_quantity.
#  Write a class method called increase that increases the quantity by 1 each time it is invoked. 
# You should also write a __str__ method for this class that returns a string of the format: 
# "A basket of [quantity goes here] [color goes here] apples." e.g. "A basket of 4 red apples."
#  or "A basket of 50 blue apples." (Writing some test code that creates instances and assigns values
#  to variables may help you solve this problem!)

#  has [start_amt goes here] dollars." Create an instance of this class with "Bob" as the name and 100 as the amount.
# Save this to the variable t1.

#There is a function we are providing in for you in this problem called square.
#It takes one integer and returns the square of that integer value. Write code to assign a variable called xyz the value 5*5 (five squared). 
#Use the square function, rather than just multiplying with '''

#Write code to assign the number of characters in the string rv to a variable num_chars
